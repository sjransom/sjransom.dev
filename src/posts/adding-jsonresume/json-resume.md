This guide will assume you already have a blog built with Gatsby already set up, if you haven't you can build one following the guide in this [post](./building-this-blog).

The [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) is an open-source project to create a JSON-based standard for resumes. You may ask 'why would you want to use this?' - personally I think it's much cleaner to have all your information stored in one central JSON file rather than keeping it inside static HTML files, it's much easier to update in the future and also if you ever want to change the theme of your resume this will make it a lot less fiddly.
